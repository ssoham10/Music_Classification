This project was completed as a Final Year Thesis/Project of my Bachelor's degree in a group of 4. First part comprises of Classification of an audio file (.wav) into one of the 10 genres including rock, hiphop, classical and more.
K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm was used to train this classification model. Initially, the model accuracy was only 63%. After increasing the size of the dataset from 1000 rows to 9990 rows, the model accuracy increased upto 84%. 
The Precision and Recall values for the model are 0.85 and 0.84 respectively.
The Recommendation model was based on the Content Based Recommendation systems. As soon as the User selects a song to play, 5 similar songs are recommended which generally are from the same artist or of the same genre. 
The classification model was hosted with the help of streamlit. Whereas the recommendation model was integrated into the website which was hosted locally.
